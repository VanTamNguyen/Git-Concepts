All about Git. Git concepts. Cit commands...


#### 1. Basic Concepts
* **Local repository** is a private workplace as *working copy* for developer to make changes. And after commit, these changes become part of remote repository (permanent stored on server).

* **Working directory and Staging area or Index**

* **Blob** stands for Binary Large Object. Each version of a file is reprensted by blob. Blob holds the file data but does not contain any metadata about the file. It is a binary file, and in Git databases, it is named as the SHA1 hash of that file. In Git, files are not addressed by names. Everything is content-addressed.

* **Tree**
* **Commit**
* **Branch**
* **Tag**
* **Clone**
* **Pull**
* **Push**
* **HEAD**
* **Revision**
* **URL**
